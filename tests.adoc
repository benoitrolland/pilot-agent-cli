== Running Tests

To execute tests in this project, use the following command in the terminal:

[source,shell]
----
npm test
----

This command runs the complete Jest test suite with TDD coverage.

=== Alternative test commands

[source,shell]
----
# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run integrated CLI tests

== Test Architecture

Our tests follow the hexagonal architecture:

[source]
----
tests/
├── domain/              # Business logic tests
│   ├── entities/        # Entity tests
│   └── services/        # Service tests
└── infrastructure/      # Adapter tests
    └── adapters/        # Infrastructure adapter tests

== Requirements

Make sure you are in the project root directory and that all dependencies are installed with `npm install`.

== TDD Principles Applied

. **Red**: Write a failing test
. **Green**: Write minimal code to make it pass
. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

== Test Coverage

Current coverage: **38 tests passing** with 80% minimum threshold for:
- Branches
- Functions
- Lines
- Statements
